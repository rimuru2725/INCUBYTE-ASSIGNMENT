- **Frontend:** React, Vite, TailwindCSS
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## Setup Instructions
(Instructions will be added as the project evolves)

## My AI Usage
I am using an AI assistant (Antigravity by Google DeepMind) to pair program this application.

### AI Tools Used
- **Antigravity:** Used for planning, generating boilerplate code, writing tests for TDD, and debugging.

### Usage Reflection
- **Planning:** The AI helped break down the requirements into a clear task list and implementation plan.
- **TDD:** The AI is instrumental in writing the "Red" tests first, ensuring comprehensive coverage before implementation.
- **Boilerplate:** Accelerated setup by generating initial file structures and configuration.
